# character_counter
#This is a react web app that allows user to input infinite amount of letters into a text box.

#This project was built to accomplish a challenge

#The problems that were solved were counting the characters in the text box without using a piece of paper.

#I learned soft skills with react that will allow me to build a more complex character counter in the future.
